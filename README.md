# Puppeteer Screenshot demo

If you clone this repository, edit `screenshot.js` with your chosen website, and then run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node screenshot.js https://cassidoo.co
```

You'll get both a PNG and a PDF of your website! You can swap out that URL at the end of the script with anything.
